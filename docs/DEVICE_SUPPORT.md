# Device Support Matrix

This page is the shipped OpenSnek support matrix by device and transport.

This pass is derived from the implementation, not just protocol notes:
- device/profile metadata: [`OpenSnek/Sources/OpenSnekCore/DeviceSupport.swift`](../OpenSnek/Sources/OpenSnekCore/DeviceSupport.swift)
- USB state + writes: [`OpenSnek/Sources/OpenSnek/Bridge/BridgeClient+USB.swift`](../OpenSnek/Sources/OpenSnek/Bridge/BridgeClient+USB.swift)
- Bluetooth state + writes: [`OpenSnek/Sources/OpenSnek/Bridge/BridgeClient+Bluetooth.swift`](../OpenSnek/Sources/OpenSnek/Bridge/BridgeClient+Bluetooth.swift)
- UI exposure and feature gating: [`OpenSnek/Sources/OpenSnek/UI/DeviceDetailView.swift`](../OpenSnek/Sources/OpenSnek/UI/DeviceDetailView.swift) and [`OpenSnek/Sources/OpenSnek/Services/EditorStore.swift`](../OpenSnek/Sources/OpenSnek/Services/EditorStore.swift)

This matrix tracks shipped hardware-facing support. Internal editor/workspace plumbing does not count as shipped device support unless the hardware behavior is actually exposed and supported in the app.

Use [docs/protocol/PARITY.md](./protocol/PARITY.md) for lower-level reverse-engineering notes and capture-backed protocol gaps.

## Status Key

Overall transport status:
- `Validated`: the shipped profile is locally validated in `DeviceSupport.swift`
- `Contributor validated`: the shipped profile is based on external contributor hardware validation and has not been locally validated by OpenSnek maintainers
- `Mapped`: the shipped profile exists, but the profile metadata is still marked unvalidated
- `Not shipped`: the hardware transport may exist, but OpenSnek does not claim support for it yet
- `No transport`: that device does not offer that transport

Feature rows:
- `Shipped`: implemented in the backend and surfaced by the current app for that device/transport
- `Contributor validated`: implemented based on contributor-validated hardware behavior, but not locally validated by OpenSnek maintainers
- `Limited`: shipped, but with reduced scope such as static-only lighting or documented read-only button slots
- `Mapped`: comes from a shipped but still unvalidated mapped profile
- `Not shipped`: the app intentionally does not claim or expose this hardware feature as supported yet
- `Hidden`: the current bridge/UI does not surface that feature on this transport
- `Scalar only`: the profile does not ship independent X/Y DPI editing
- `Single slot`: no multi-slot onboard button-profile workflow exists for that device/transport

Button remap keyboard actions support modifier chords on shipped USB and Bluetooth profiles through the shared `modifier byte + HID key` function block.

## Quick Summary

| Device | USB | BT | Biggest Gaps |
|---|---|---|---|
| Basilisk V3 X HyperSpeed | `Validated` | `Validated` | Bluetooth keeps lighting to static color, hides poll-rate and threshold controls, and leaves the Hypershift/sniper path read-only |
| Basilisk V3 | `Mapped` | `No transport` | Shares the Basilisk V3 USB family configuration, but remains unvalidated on local hardware |
| Basilisk V3 Pro | `Validated` | `Validated` | Ships mapped onboard profile CRUD on USB and Bluetooth; Bluetooth keeps lighting static-only, hides poll-rate and threshold controls, and does not ship clutch/profile-button remap |
| Basilisk V3 35K | `Validated` | `No transport` | Shares the Basilisk V3 USB family configuration with mapped onboard profile CRUD; no Bluetooth transport |
| Orochi V2 | `Not shipped` | `Contributor validated` | Contributor validated Bluetooth DPI stages, battery, and no-RGB behavior; button remap is profile-mapped pending hardware readback validation |
| Naga Pro | `Contributor validated` | `Contributor validated` | Core controls and known-safe side-panel slots ship; unknown native defaults and class-`0x03` panel actions remain preserved |
| Basilisk (2017) | `Contributor validated` | `No transport` | Contributor validated DPI (scalar, independent X/Y, live 5-stage table), poll-rate reads, and logo/scroll lighting with restore-verified writes; button remap and onboard profiles are not mapped |
| Lancehead Tournament Edition | `Contributor validated` | `No transport` | Contributor validated DPI (scalar, independent X/Y, live 5-stage table read without OpenRazer's `0xFF` stage transaction), poll-rate reads, and all four lighting zones; button remap is not mapped |
| Huntsman Mini | `Contributor validated` | `No transport` | Keyboard: contributor validated backlight lighting, brightness, and that poll-rate reads return `status 0x05` (unsupported). No DPI hardware; key remap is not mapped |
| Tartarus Pro | `Contributor validated` | `No transport` | Keypad: contributor validated backlight lighting and brightness (LED `0x00` and `0x05` alias the same register). Analog actuation and key remap have no public protocol; OpenSnek never switches this device into driver mode |
| Kraken Kitty V2 | `Mapped` | `No transport` | Headset: exposes only a single consumer-control USB HID interface (no 90-byte Razer control interface), so it speaks a separate legacy protocol (`KrakenLegacyProtocol` / `KrakenLegacyControlSession`) instead of the shared class/cmd protocol. Lighting-only; not yet hardware validated |

## Basilisk V3 USB Family Assumptions

For future USB feature work, treat the wired Basilisk V3 (`0x0099`), Basilisk V3 Pro (`0x00AA`/`0x00AB`), and Basilisk V3 35K (`0x00CB`) as one shared Basilisk V3 USB family unless hardware validation proves a device-specific exception.

- USB lighting effect work should start from the assumption that all three share the same `0x0F` zone-effect set and the same three public zones: scroll wheel `0x01`, logo `0x04`, and underglow `0x0A`.
- USB onboard-profile work uses the same mapped core profile API shape documented in [USB_PROFILE_CRUD_SPEC.md](./protocol/USB_PROFILE_CRUD_SPEC.md) across the family; keep device-specific exceptions out of the implementation unless hardware validation proves one.
- The Basilisk V3 X HyperSpeed is not part of this family assumption; it has its own simpler USB/Bluetooth profile shape.

## Basilisk V3 X HyperSpeed

USB PID `0x00B9`, Bluetooth PID `0x00BA`

| Feature Area | USB | BT | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Overall transport status | `Validated` | `Validated` | Both transports ship today |
| DPI stages + active stage | `Shipped` | `Shipped` | Bluetooth state comes from `readBluetoothState()` plus the passive DPI tracker |
| Independent X/Y DPI | `Scalar only` | `Scalar only` | This profile ships scalar DPI only because `supportsIndependentXYDPI` is false on both transports |
| Poll rate | `Shipped` | `Hidden` | USB uses the shared `getPollRate` / `setPollRate` path; Bluetooth state hard-codes `poll_rate: nil` and `capabilities.poll_rate: false` |
| Sleep timeout | `Shipped` | `Shipped` | USB reads `getIdleTime`; Bluetooth reads `powerTimeoutGet` and exposes the power-management card |
| Low battery threshold | `Shipped` | `Hidden` | USB reads `getLowBatteryThreshold`; Bluetooth never puts a threshold value into `MouseState`, so the UI never renders the threshold card |
| Battery telemetry | `Shipped` | `Shipped` | Bluetooth uses vendor battery reads; the AA-powered BT path intentionally reports `charging = false` |
| Lighting: brightness + static color | `Shipped` | `Shipped` | The profile ships one lighting zone (`0x01`) on both transports |
| Lighting: extra effects | `Shipped` | `Limited` | USB exposes `off`, `static`, `spectrum`, `wave`, `reactive`, `pulseSingle`, `pulseDual`, and `pulseRandom`; Bluetooth is static-only because the BT profile advertises only `.staticColor` |
| Button remap: shipped editable slots | `Shipped` | `Shipped` | USB and BT writable slots are `1-5`, `9`, `10`, and `96` from the profile metadata |
| Button remap: unsupported slots | `Shipped` | `Hidden` | USB has no extra unsupported slots documented on this profile; Bluetooth slot `6` Hypershift/sniper is not surfaced as a control and only appears in the unsupported-buttons footnote |
| Scroll controls | `Shipped` | `Hidden` | USB has shared `get/setScrollMode`, `get/setScrollAcceleration`, and `get/setScrollSmartReel`; Bluetooth never populates those state fields and the UI excludes BT scroll controls |
| Onboard hardware profiles | `Single slot` | `Single slot` | Both transports ship with `onboardProfileCount = 1`, so there is no hardware multi-profile surface to expose here |

## Basilisk V3

USB PID `0x0099`, no Bluetooth transport

| Feature Area | USB | BT | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Overall transport status | `Mapped` | `No transport` | The shipped USB profile is derived from OpenRazer plus the 35K layout, not yet locally validated in OpenSnek |
| DPI stages + active stage | `Mapped` | `No transport` | The mapped USB profile clamps DPI to `26,000` |
| Independent X/Y DPI | `Mapped` | `No transport` | The mapped V3 USB profile inherits the shared Basilisk V3 USB family independent X/Y DPI configuration |
| Poll rate | `Mapped` | `No transport` | Uses the shared USB poll-rate read/write path through the mapped profile |
| Sleep timeout | `Mapped` | `No transport` | Uses the shared USB idle-time path through the mapped profile |
| Low battery threshold | `Mapped` | `No transport` | Uses the shared USB threshold path through the mapped profile |
| Battery telemetry | `Mapped` | `No transport` | Uses the shared USB battery path through the mapped profile |
| Lighting: brightness + static color | `Mapped` | `No transport` | The mapped profile ships the shared Basilisk V3 USB family zones: `0x01`, `0x04`, and `0x0A` |
| Lighting: extra effects | `Mapped` | `No transport` | The mapped USB profile advertises the shared Basilisk V3 USB family set: `off`, `static`, `spectrum`, and `wave` |
| Button remap: shipped editable slots | `Mapped` | `No transport` | The mapped USB profile exposes writable slots `1-5`, `9`, `10`, `15`, `52`, `53`, and `96` |
| Button remap: unsupported slots | `Hidden` | `No transport` | The mapped profile documents slot `14` and slot `106` as unsupported footnote entries rather than editable controls |
| Scroll controls | `Mapped` | `No transport` | The mapped profile rides the same shared USB scroll-control implementation as the other USB Basilisk profiles |
| Onboard hardware profiles | `Mapped` | `No transport` | The mapped V3 USB profile exposes the shared inventory-backed core profile CRUD surface: list, read, create, rename, update, delete/unassign, activate, and passive profile-cycle refresh |

## Basilisk V3 Pro

USB PIDs `0x00AA` / `0x00AB`, Bluetooth PID `0x00AC`

| Feature Area | USB | BT | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Overall transport status | `Validated` | `Validated` | Both transports ship today |
| DPI stages + active stage | `Shipped` | `Shipped` | USB and BT both ship stage editing; the BT path also feeds passive HID DPI updates into app state |
| Independent X/Y DPI | `Shipped` | `Shipped` | `supportsIndependentXYDPI` is true on both transports |
| Poll rate | `Shipped` | `Hidden` | USB uses the shared `getPollRate` / `setPollRate` path; BT hard-codes `poll_rate: nil` and `capabilities.poll_rate: false` |
| Sleep timeout | `Shipped` | `Shipped` | USB reads idle time; BT reads `powerTimeoutGet` and exposes the same power-management card |
| Low battery threshold | `Shipped` | `Hidden` | USB reads and writes threshold values; BT does not populate `low_battery_threshold_raw`, so the current app never shows the threshold card there |
| Battery telemetry | `Shipped` | `Shipped` | BT state publishes battery percent; BT charging is only surfaced when a USB fallback session can verify it |
| Lighting: brightness + static color | `Shipped` | `Shipped` | USB ships three onboard zones; BT ships per-zone brightness and per-zone static color on `0x01`, `0x04`, and `0x0A`. The V3 USB family is modeled with 14 individually addressable Custom Frame cells (1 logo + 1 scroll wheel + 12 underglow/tail cells) via `Class 0x0F Cmd 0x03`, which OpenSnek uses for volatile USB Advanced software lighting while the app/service is running; see [docs/research/BASILISK_V3_PRO_PERLED_UNDERGLOW.md](./research/BASILISK_V3_PRO_PERLED_UNDERGLOW.md). OpenSnek's onboard model remains the shipped three-zone subset. |
| Lighting: extra effects | `Shipped` | `Limited` | USB advertises the shared onboard Basilisk V3 USB family set: `off`, `static`, `spectrum`, and `wave`. V3 Pro USB also exposes Advanced software presets, including the Battery Meter underglow progress bar gated to this profile because it is the shipped device with both the light strip and battery telemetry. BT is static-only because the BT profile advertises only `.staticColor` |
| Button remap: shipped editable slots | `Shipped` | `Shipped` | USB writable slots are `1-5`, `9`, `10`, `15`, `52`, `53`, and `96`; BT writable slots are `1-5`, `9`, `10`, `52`, `53` |
| Button remap: unsupported slots | `Hidden` | `Hidden` | USB slot `14` and profile button `106` are kept out of the editable layout; BT clutch `15` and profile button `106` are also kept out of the editable layout and only appear as unsupported footnotes |
| Scroll controls | `Shipped` | `Hidden` | V3 Pro USB uses profile-scoped `get/setScrollMode`, `get/setScrollAcceleration`, and `get/setScrollSmartReel`; BT never publishes those fields and the UI excludes BT scroll controls |
| Onboard hardware profiles | `Shipped` | `Shipped` | V3 Pro USB and BT expose inventory-backed mapped core profile CRUD: list, read, create, rename, update, delete/unassign, activate, and passive profile-cycle refresh. Profile snapshots include metadata, DPI, mapped button bindings, brightness, USB scroll controls, USB/BT static color where mapped, and leave global settings plus advanced profile surfaces outside the v1 profile snapshot. |

| Button remap: unsupported slots | `Hidden` | `No transport` | Slot `14` and slot `106` are documented as unsupported footnote entries rather than editable controls |
| Scroll controls | `Shipped` | `No transport` | The 35K USB profile uses the shared `get/setScrollMode`, `get/setScrollAcceleration`, and `get/setScrollSmartReel` implementation |
| Onboard hardware profiles | `Shipped` | `No transport` | The 35K USB profile exposes the shared inventory-backed core profile CRUD surface: list, read, create, rename, update, delete/unassign, activate, and passive profile-cycle refresh |

## Orochi V2

Bluetooth PID `0x0095`; 2.4 GHz HyperSpeed dongle path not yet shipped.

| Feature Area | USB | BT | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Overall transport status | `Not shipped` | `Contributor validated` | Bluetooth profile is based on contributor-validated DPI stages, battery, and no-RGB capability behavior |
| DPI stages + active stage | `Not shipped` | `Contributor validated` | Contributor validated Bluetooth stage readback with five stages up to `18,000` DPI |
| Independent X/Y DPI | `Not shipped` | `Scalar only` | The profile ships scalar DPI only because `supportsIndependentXYDPI` is false |
| Poll rate | `Not shipped` | `Hidden` | Bluetooth state hard-codes `poll_rate: nil` and `capabilities.poll_rate: false` |
| Sleep timeout | `Not shipped` | `Mapped` | Rides the shared Bluetooth `powerTimeoutGet` / `powerTimeoutSet` path; Orochi-specific read/write validation is still pending |
| Low battery threshold | `Not shipped` | `Hidden` | Bluetooth does not populate `low_battery_threshold_raw`, so the app never renders the threshold card |
| Battery telemetry | `Not shipped` | `Contributor validated` | Contributor validated Bluetooth battery reads; OpenSnek reports `charging = false` for this AAA-powered profile |
| Lighting: brightness + static color | `Not shipped` | `Hidden` | The profile declares no lighting effects, zones, or LED IDs; Bluetooth state reports `capabilities.lighting = false` |
| Lighting: extra effects | `Not shipped` | `Hidden` | Orochi V2 has no RGB lighting |
| Button remap: shipped editable slots | `Not shipped` | `Mapped` | Profile metadata maps slots `1-5`, `9`, `10`, and `96`, but hardware read/write/readback validation is still pending |
| Button remap: unsupported slots | `Not shipped` | `Hidden` | No extra unsupported Orochi-specific slots are documented yet |
| Scroll controls | `Not shipped` | `Hidden` | Bluetooth never publishes scroll-control state fields and the UI excludes BT scroll controls |
| Onboard hardware profiles | `Not shipped` | `Single slot` | Profile ships with `onboardProfileCount = 1` |

## Naga Pro

USB PIDs `0x008F` (wired) / `0x0090` (2.4 GHz receiver), Bluetooth PID `0x0092`.

Support is based on hardware validation reported by [varunyellina in PR #106](https://github.com/gh123man/OpenSnek/pull/106); OpenSnek maintainers do not currently possess this device.

| Feature Area | USB | BT | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Overall transport status | `Contributor validated` | `Contributor validated` | The contributor exercised wired, receiver, and Bluetooth paths on physical hardware |
| DPI stages + active stage | `Contributor validated` | `Contributor validated` | Scalar DPI is capped at `20,000` |
| Independent X/Y DPI | `Scalar only` | `Scalar only` | The Naga Pro profile intentionally does not advertise independent X/Y editing |
| Lighting: brightness + static color | `Contributor validated` | `Contributor validated` | OpenSnek exposes scroll-wheel `0x01` and logo `0x04` zones; advanced effects are not claimed |
| Button remap: shipped editable slots | `Limited` | `Limited` | Body/2-button-panel slots `1-5`, `9`, `10`, `52`, `53`; 12-button panel slots `64-75`; and known 6-button panel slots `80-82` are editable |
| Button remap: preserved slots | `Limited` | `Limited` | Slots `83-85` use an undecoded native class-`0x03` block and remain read-only. Side-panel slots `64-75` and `80-82` allow explicit remaps but do not offer `Default` until their factory blocks are captured |
| Onboard hardware profiles | `Limited` | `Limited` | Five-slot mapped core profile workflows ship, but OpenSnek omits unknown side-panel defaults from synthesized/replaced profiles and refuses a full reset unless every writable slot has a known factory block |

The remaining device-dependent work is tracked in [issue #56](https://github.com/gh123man/OpenSnek/issues/56).
## Basilisk (2017)

USB PID `0x0064`, no Bluetooth transport. This is the original 2017 Basilisk; it is not part of the Basilisk V3 USB family assumptions. Ships transaction ID `0x1F` (contributor validated; hardware also answers OpenRazer's `0x3F`).

| Feature Area | USB | BT | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Overall transport status | `Contributor validated` | `No transport` | OpenRazer-derived profile with contributor hardware validation of DPI, poll-rate reads, and lighting (write + readback + restore) |
| DPI stages + active stage | `Contributor validated` | `No transport` | Clamped to `16,000`. Contributor hardware returned a live 5-stage table (`04:86`) with active-stage tracking even though OpenRazer never exposed stages for this device |
| Independent X/Y DPI | `Contributor validated` | `No transport` | Distinct X/Y writes read back exactly on contributor hardware |
| Poll rate | `Contributor validated` | `No transport` | Poll-rate reads validated (500 Hz observed); writes ride the shared USB path |
| Sleep timeout | `Not shipped` | `No transport` | Wired mouse; `supportsPowerManagementControls` is false |
| Low battery threshold | `Not shipped` | `No transport` | Wired mouse; no battery |
| Battery telemetry | `Not shipped` | `No transport` | Wired mouse; no battery |
| Lighting: brightness + static color | `Contributor validated` | `No transport` | Two zones: scroll wheel `0x01` and logo `0x04`; brightness and static color validated with write + readback + restore |
| Lighting: extra effects | `Contributor validated` | `No transport` | `off`, `static`, `spectrum`, `reactive`, and the pulse set validated on contributor hardware; OpenRazer does not expose wave on this device |
| Button remap: shipped editable slots | `Not shipped` | `No transport` | `supportsButtonRemapControls` is false; no capture-backed function-block layout exists yet |
| Button remap: unsupported slots | `Hidden` | `No transport` | The standard mouse slots are visible read-only in the profile metadata |
| Scroll controls | `Not shipped` | `No transport` | `supportsScrollModeControls` is false |

## Lancehead Tournament Edition

USB PID `0x0060` (wired), no Bluetooth transport. Ships transaction ID `0x1F` (contributor validated; hardware also answers OpenRazer's `0x3F`).

| Feature Area | USB | BT | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Overall transport status | `Contributor validated` | `No transport` | OpenRazer-derived profile with contributor hardware validation of DPI, poll-rate reads, and all four lighting zones (write + readback + restore) |
| DPI stages + active stage | `Contributor validated` | `No transport` | Clamped to `16,000`. Contributor hardware returned a live 5-stage table under transaction `0x1F`; OpenRazer's `0xFF` stage-transaction quirk was not needed |
| Independent X/Y DPI | `Contributor validated` | `No transport` | Distinct X/Y writes read back exactly on contributor hardware |
| Poll rate | `Contributor validated` | `No transport` | Poll-rate reads validated (500 Hz observed); writes ride the shared USB path |
| Sleep timeout | `Not shipped` | `No transport` | Wired mouse; `supportsPowerManagementControls` is false |

| Scroll controls | `Not shipped` | `No transport` | `supportsScrollModeControls` is false |
| Onboard hardware profiles | `Single slot` | `No transport` | Profile ships with `onboardProfileCount = 1`; OpenRazer exposes VARSTORE DPI stages but OpenSnek has not mapped a profile CRUD surface for this device |

## Huntsman Mini

USB PID `0x0257`, no Bluetooth transport. Keyboard (`formFactor = .keyboard`); the first non-mouse device profile in OpenSnek. Ships transaction ID `0x1F` (contributor validated; OpenRazer uses `0x3F`). The JP variant (`0x0269`) and the Analog variant (`0x0282`) are not registered.

| Feature Area | USB | BT | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Overall transport status | `Contributor validated` | `No transport` | Lighting-only profile; contributor hardware validated serial/effects/brightness over the 90-byte feature-report interface |
| DPI stages + active stage | `Not shipped` | `No transport` | The keyboard has no DPI hardware; `supportsDPIControls` is false and USB state reads skip DPI commands, using serial/firmware reads for reachability |
| Independent X/Y DPI | `Not shipped` | `No transport` | No DPI hardware |
| Poll rate | `Not shipped` | `No transport` | Contributor hardware returns `status 0x05` (unsupported) for poll-rate reads, confirming `supportsPollRateControls = false` |
| Sleep timeout | `Not shipped` | `No transport` | Wired keyboard; no power management |
| Low battery threshold | `Not shipped` | `No transport` | Wired keyboard; no battery |
| Battery telemetry | `Not shipped` | `No transport` | Wired keyboard; no battery |
| Lighting: brightness + static color | `Contributor validated` | `No transport` | One zone: backlight LED `0x05`; brightness and static color validated with write + readback + restore |
| Lighting: extra effects | `Contributor validated` | `No transport` | `off`, `static`, `spectrum`, `wave`, `reactive`, and the pulse set validated on contributor hardware; OpenRazer's starlight and per-key custom-frame effects (5x15 matrix) are not shipped |
| Button remap: shipped editable slots | `Not shipped` | `No transport` | Key remap is not mapped; the profile ships an empty button layout |
| Button remap: unsupported slots | `Hidden` | `No transport` | No slots are documented |
| Scroll controls | `Not shipped` | `No transport` | Not applicable to a keyboard |
| Onboard hardware profiles | `Single slot` | `No transport` | Profile ships with `onboardProfileCount = 1`; USB state reads skip the mouse onboard-profile commands for non-mouse form factors |

## Tartarus Pro

USB PID `0x0244`, no Bluetooth transport. Keypad (`formFactor = .keypad`). Uses USB transaction ID `0x1F`; contributor hardware validated breathing/pulse effects under `0x1F` too, so OpenRazer's `0x3F` breath quirk needs no per-effect override.

| Feature Area | USB | BT | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Overall transport status | `Contributor validated` | `No transport` | Lighting-only profile; contributor hardware validated serial/effects/brightness over the 90-byte feature-report interface |
| DPI stages + active stage | `Not shipped` | `No transport` | No DPI hardware; `supportsDPIControls` is false and USB state reads skip DPI commands, using serial/firmware reads for reachability |
| Independent X/Y DPI | `Not shipped` | `No transport` | No DPI hardware |
| Poll rate | `Not shipped` | `No transport` | Contributor hardware returns `status 0x05` (unsupported) for poll-rate reads; OpenRazer does not register poll-rate controls either |
| Sleep timeout | `Not shipped` | `No transport` | Wired keypad; no power management |
| Low battery threshold | `Not shipped` | `No transport` | Wired keypad; no battery |
| Battery telemetry | `Not shipped` | `No transport` | Wired keypad; no battery |
| Lighting: brightness + static color | `Contributor validated` | `No transport` | Effects target backlight LED `0x05`; brightness keeps OpenRazer's LED `0x00` addressing via `usbBrightnessLEDIDs`. Contributor hardware showed LED `0x00` and `0x05` alias the same brightness register (writes to either update both readbacks) |
| Lighting: extra effects | `Contributor validated` | `No transport` | `off`, `static`, `spectrum`, `wave`, `reactive`, and the pulse set validated on contributor hardware; starlight and per-key custom frames are not shipped |
| Button remap: shipped editable slots | `Not shipped` | `No transport` | Key remap and analog actuation have no public protocol (OpenRazer exposes neither); the profile ships an empty button layout |
| Button remap: unsupported slots | `Hidden` | `No transport` | No slots are documented |
| Scroll controls | `Not shipped` | `No transport` | Not applicable to a keypad |
| Onboard hardware profiles | `Single slot` | `No transport` | Profile ships with `onboardProfileCount = 1`. OpenRazer deliberately never switches the Tartarus Pro into driver mode (`DRIVER_MODE = False`) because its analog input handling misbehaves; OpenSnek likewise only reads device mode and must not write mode `0x03` to this device |

## Kraken Kitty V2

USB PID `0x0560`, no Bluetooth transport. Headset (`formFactor = .headset`). Unlike every other profile in this matrix, this device does not speak the shared Razer class/cmd feature-report protocol at all: macOS only exposes a single consumer-control USB HID interface for it (no 90-byte feature-report control interface), so `usesKrakenLegacyProtocol` routes it through a dedicated `KrakenLegacyControlSession` / `KrakenLegacyProtocol` pair instead of `USBHIDControlSession`. See [KRAKEN_LEGACY_PROTOCOL.md](./protocol/KRAKEN_LEGACY_PROTOCOL.md) for the address map. Not yet validated on real hardware; the protocol module and hardware transport are still being finalized.

| Feature Area | USB | BT | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Overall transport status | `Mapped` | `No transport` | Lighting-only profile; routed through the legacy Kraken protocol instead of the shared class/cmd interface. Awaiting hardware validation |
| DPI stages + active stage | `Not shipped` | `No transport` | No DPI hardware; `supportsDPIControls` is false and the fast-DPI-poll path returns `nil` immediately |
| Independent X/Y DPI | `Not shipped` | `No transport` | No DPI hardware |
| Poll rate | `Not shipped` | `No transport` | No poll-rate hardware; `supportsPollRateControls` is false |
| Sleep timeout | `Not shipped` | `No transport` | Wired headset; no power management |
| Low battery threshold | `Not shipped` | `No transport` | Wired headset; no battery |
| Battery telemetry | `Not shipped` | `No transport` | Wired headset; no battery |
| Lighting: static color | `Mapped` | `No transport` | Static color writes the custom-color RAM address and the LED-mode byte via `KrakenLegacyProtocol.setEffectReports` |
| Lighting: extra effects | `Mapped` | `No transport` | `off`, `spectrum`, `pulseSingle` (single-color breathing), and `pulseDual` (two-color breathing) are mapped; wave, reactive, `pulseRandom`, and three-color breathing are not exposed because the UI-facing `LightingEffectKind` set has no equivalent for them |
| Button remap: shipped editable slots | `Not shipped` | `No transport` | No button hardware surfaced; the profile ships an empty button layout |
| Button remap: unsupported slots | `Hidden` | `No transport` | No slots are documented |
| Scroll controls | `Not shipped` | `No transport` | Not applicable to a headset |
| Onboard hardware profiles | `Single slot` | `No transport` | Profile ships with `onboardProfileCount = 1`; USB state reads skip the mouse onboard-profile commands for non-mouse form factors |
